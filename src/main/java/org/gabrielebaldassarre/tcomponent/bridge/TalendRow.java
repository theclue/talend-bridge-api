/**
 * TalendRows are row-like structures that belong to TalendFlow elements and act as container of cell-like objects like TalendValue instances.<br />
 * This means that they are organized in OOP fashion (developers that uses ORM systems or graph-based databases
 * would find some familiar elements).<br />
 * If the belonging flow support transactions, this features is inherited by rows that become <em>lazy</em>. This means that operations made using setValue calls are not
 * immediately pushed to rows, but only after a TalendFlow's commit() call.<br /> 
 * Since rows have no sense outside of a flow, they cannot be built directly, but a factory model is provided by the data model for this purpose.<br />
 * For the same reason, a row cannot be detached from its flow.<br />
 * Example of use:<br />
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // providing you have a valid flow model instance in tmodel
 * 
 * TalendFlowFactory tablefactory = tmodel.getFlowFactory();
 * TalendRowFactory rowFactory = tmodel.getRowFactory();
 * 
 * // Create a new flow 'pit' unlimited in size and with transaction support
 * TalendFlow endlessPit = tablefactory.newFlow("pit", null, true);
 * 
 * // Create a new column in 'pit' of type String and default value 'foo'
 * endlessPit.addColumn("col1", TalendType.STRING, "foo");
 * 
 * // Create a new row in 'pit' and set the value of 'col1' to 'bar'
 * TalendRow row = rowFactory.newRow(endlessPit).setValue("col1", "bar");
 * 
 * // Since the changes are still not commited to row, col1 has still the default value of 'foo'
 * System.out.println(row.getValue("col1"); // foo
 * 
 * // Commit changes
 * endlessPit.commit();
 * 
 * System.out.println(row.getValue("col1"); // bar
 * }
 * </pre>
