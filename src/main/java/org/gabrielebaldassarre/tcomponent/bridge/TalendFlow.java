/**
 * Flows are data structures that can hold data in tabular-format, like tables in typical
 * RDBMS, but whit some neat additional features.<br />
 * First of all, data is organized in OOP fashion (developers that uses ORM systems or graph-based databases
 * would find some familiar elements), where columns, rows and even single cells are objects.<br />
 * Flows can be used like regular tables - an endeless pit to store and retrieve unlimited amount of rows - or buffers
 * - limited in size and organized with a FIFO strategy. This is useful when planned data manipulations doesn't need the entire data
 * set (ie. a group by transformation) but only a limited buffer of newest rows (ie. a t-7 moving average calculation) and you don't
 * want to waste memory.<br />
 * Aside that, a compact and efficient subset of table-like features, like defaultvalue, primary key and index is provided.<br />
 * Please not that method to <strong>remove</strong>rows are not provided, as the intended use of flow is as temporary area to hold data for data manipulations ans
 * <strong>not</strong> as a persistent DB-like are to store data. That's why many typical data operations are limited and many others are complitely disallowed.<br >
 * The deep of the buffer is set using the maximumSize parameter when a new flow is built using methods provided by {@link TalendFlowFactory}.<br />
 * Here's some examples on how to build and how to use flows:<br />
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // providing you have a valid flow model instance in tmodel
 * 
 * TalendFlowFactory tablefactory = tmodel.getFlowFactory();
 * 
 * // Create a new flow named 'singleRow' with maximumSize=0 (without buffer, only the current row is stored) and without transaction support
 * TalendFlow singleRow = tablefactory.newFlow("buffer1", 0, false);
 * 
 * // Create a new flow 'movingAverage' holding 6 rows behind the current row and transaction support
 * TalendFlow movingAverage = tablefactory.newFlow("movingA", 6, true);
 * 
 * // Create a new flow 'pit' unlimited in size and with transaction support
 * TalendFlow endlessPit = tablefactory.newFlow("pit", null, true);
 * 
 * // Create a new column in 'pit' of type String and default value 'foo'
 * endlessPit.addColumn("col1", TalendType.STRING, "foo");
 * }
 * </pre>
